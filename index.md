Hello!

This website's aim is to compile/organize technical information I find interesting. This mainly includes how-to's, course details, and discussion of problems I've had to tackle.

- Why call it 'Read-the-Ducks' ?

It is an amalgalm of 'Read the ~Docks~ Docs' and 'Rubber Duck Programming'.

Sections are dedicated to reviewing the following book(s):
- **C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition).** Available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/C-Programming-2e-K-King/dp/0393979504/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=C+Programming%3A+A+Modern+Approach&qid=1608726735&sr=8-1).
