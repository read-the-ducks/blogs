To understand C's origin, we must look at the history of the UNIX operating system developed by Bell labs. UNIX was first written in Assembly, then partially re-writen in a newly designed programming language called B. As iterations of UNIX went on, an extended version of B was needed, leading to the development of the C language. Re-writting UNIX in C allowed the system to be **more portable**, as Bell Labs already wrote C compilers dedicated to other machines they were working on at the time.

The book *The C Programming Language* was considered for a long time as the de-facto reference for most C programmers, but the book still remained ambiguous about different features and continous updates of the C language. This led to major differences between C compilers, threatening C's portability.

### C Standards

A U.S. standard for C was released in 1989 to address this issue under the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and was subsequently approved by the *International Organization for Standardization* (ISO) in 1990. This version of the language is referred as *C89/C90*, to differentiate it from the original version of C, usually referred to as *K&R C*. A revisited standard for C was also released in 1999, it is commonly referred as *C99*

### C-Based Languages

There are many C-based languages, the most prominent include :
- *C++* : Includes all features of C, with additional support for classes and OOP.
- *Java* : Based on C++, and therefore on C
- *C#* : Derived from C++ and Java

Learning C allows you to gain more insight on languages based on it, like those mentioned above. C is also widely used in applications where memory and processing power is limited.
